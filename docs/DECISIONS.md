# Decisions

Append-only. Never edit or delete an entry. If a decision changes, add a new dated entry
that says which entry it supersedes.

Entries dated 2026-10-02 were recorded on that date; most were decided in the preceding weeks.

---

### D1 — 2026-10-02 — Rebuild as a new system, alongside the existing one
The existing FastAPI app (`gonzocar/`) is not extended. A new system is built from scratch.
The old app is a reference for behaviour only. No data migration. Both systems run side by side
and the client keeps whichever parses and matches payments more accurately.
**Why:** client wants a clean application. Decided by Saad with the client.

### D2 — 2026-10-02 — Stack: NestJS, React + Vite, PostgreSQL, Prisma, TailAdmin
Supersedes the Supabase backend recommended in the original proposal.
**Why:** team choice. TailAdmin Pro gives a ready admin UI. The original proposal assumed a
localStorage prototype; the client turned out to have a working FastAPI system instead.

### D3 — 2026-10-02 — Two repos in one workspace
`car-rental-backend-nestjs` and `car-rental-frontend-reactjs`, side by side. The API publishes an
OpenAPI document; the web app generates its typed client from it.
**Why:** deployed separately (Saad's call). The generated client replaces the cross-checking a
single repo would give, so the two cannot silently drift apart.

### D4 — 2026-10-02 — Railway hosting; `dev` and `main` branches
`dev` is integration; all work branches come from `dev` and PR into `dev`. `main` is staging,
deployed to Railway, updated only by a PR from `dev` opened by Saad. No `master`.

### D5 — 2026-10-02 — Money is integer cents
**Why:** floats cannot represent most decimal amounts exactly, and errors accumulate across a ledger.
The reference system passed amounts through floats.

### D6 — 2026-10-02 — Append-only ledger, idempotency in the database
No updates or deletes to ledger entries; corrections are reversals. Every retryable write has a
unique key enforced by a database constraint.
**Why:** every balance must be explainable in a driver dispute, and retries must never double-credit or double-bill.

### D7 — 2026-10-02 — Zelle confirmed through Plaid; two-stage posting
A Chase Zelle email marks a payment `reported` (suppresses reminders). The matching Plaid deposit
marks it `confirmed` and credits the ledger. Reported with no deposit after 72h → `discrepancy`.
**Why:** an email can be forged; a deposit in the bank account cannot. Zelle, Venmo and Cash App
have no public API for receiving payments, so the bank feed is the only machine-verifiable source.
The client's bank is Chase.

### D8 — 2026-10-02 — Cash App and Venmo post in one stage
A verified, validated, matched email credits the ledger directly.
**Why:** that money stays in the app balance and reaches the bank only as a lump-sum cashout, so
there is no individual bank record to confirm against.
**Status:** assumption made while writing the spec. To be confirmed with Saad.

### D9 — 2026-10-02 — LLM extraction and matching instead of hand-written parsers
LLM extracts structured payment data from each verified email; the amount must literally appear in
the email text or the result is rejected. Matching: exact alias lookup (filtered by type) first,
then LLM against the driver list, then the unrecognised bucket below a 0.9 confidence threshold.
Manual assignment creates an alias so the sender matches automatically next time.
**Why:** hand-written parsers break silently when providers change email templates. Proposed to and accepted by the client.

### D10 — 2026-10-02 — Email intake: allow-listed senders, DKIM verified
Gmail queried only for known payment senders (never `in:anywhere`). Each email requires `dkim=pass`
and an exact expected domain. Bodies stored only for payment senders.
**Why:** the reference system read the whole mailbox including spam, trusted the subject line alone
for Zelle, and stored personal mail. A forged email could credit a driver.

### D11 — 2026-10-02 — SMS modes off / dry_run / live, default dry_run
**Why:** the client was promised an off switch for every automated action. With two systems
running side by side, a live default risks drivers receiving duplicate or contradictory reminders.

### D12 — 2026-10-02 — No Stripe ACH for rent collection
**Why:** client rejected it. ACH can bounce on insufficient funds days later, is reversible, and
settles slowly. Rent must be instant and irreversible.

### D13 — 2026-10-02 — No card processing
**Why:** client rejected Stripe card payments over fees.

### D14 — 2026-10-02 — Phase 1 is payments and SMS reminders only
Contracts and e-signature, and vehicle condition / check-in, are later phases.

### D15 — 2026-10-02 — TailAdmin components copied in as needed, not the whole template
The frontend is a fresh Vite + React + TypeScript app. M0 copies the foundation once (Tailwind setup
and theme, fonts, dark mode, app shell). After that, a component is copied only when a screen needs
it, with everything it imports.
**Why:** the template is large; trimming it down leaves a repo full of code nobody understands.
Supersedes the earlier plan to start the frontend from a full copy of the template.

### D16 — 2026-10-02 — Phase 1 build order starts with authentication
Milestone order is set in `PHASE1_SPEC.md` section 11. M0 is auth and roles.
**Why:** every later screen needs a logged-in user, ledger adjustments are admin-only, and auth proves
the full chain (database, API, OpenAPI client, frontend) before money logic is built on it.
The client document groups this under "Setup and foundation"; the milestone split is ours.

### D17 — 2026-10-02 — TypeORM instead of Prisma
Supersedes the Prisma part of D2. Schema = TypeORM entity classes; changes only through generated,
reviewed migration files; `synchronize` stays off (it can drop columns at startup).
**Why:** Saad's choice. Idempotency and uniqueness rules still live in database constraints (D6).

### D18 — 2026-10-02 — Vitest instead of Jest; NestJS 12 (ES modules)
Nest 12's generator produces an ESM project with Vitest and oxlint. Kept as generated. The spec's
"Jest" is changed to "Vitest"; the describe/it/expect API is the same.
**Why:** Jest needs fragile extra configuration for ESM. Verified: constructor injection works under
Vitest (the generated unit and e2e tests pass).

### D19 — 2026-10-02 — Project name `car-rental` for local infrastructure
Docker container `car-rental-db`, volume `car-rental-db-data`, database `car_rental`, test database
`car_rental_test`, user `car_rental`. Matches the repo names.

### D20 — 2026-10-02 — Frontend foundation: light theme only, trimmed TailAdmin shell
Copied from TailAdmin: theme tokens, Outfit font, svgr icon convention, `SidebarContext`, `AppLayout`,
`Backdrop`, `Dropdown`, `cn()`. Rewritten smaller: `AppSidebar` (one nav list, no sub-menus), `AppHeader`
(no search, no notifications), `UserDropdown` (static placeholder until auth). **No dark mode**: all `dark:`
classes removed, no theme context or toggle. Text logo "Car Rental" instead of TailAdmin images.
Not copied: `react-helmet-async`/`PageMeta` (`<title>` is set in `index.html`), icon barrel entries beyond
the two in use. `react-router` is v8 (template used v7); `strict: true` added to `tsconfig.app.json`.
**Why:** Saad asked for a simple theme and basic shell (D15: copy only what a screen needs). Dark mode can be
added later by re-adding the `dark` variant and a theme context.

### D21 — 2026-10-03 — One code style in both repos: Prettier, double quotes
Both repos have the same `.prettierrc` (`singleQuote: false`, `trailingComma: "all"`) and `npm run format`.
Backend formats `src` and `test`; frontend formats `src/**/*.{ts,tsx,css}`.
**Why:** one style across the two repos; format once now so later diffs show only real changes.

### D22 — 2026-10-03 — Database conventions (users table, migrations)
- Primary keys are `uuid` with the database default `gen_random_uuid()` (built into Postgres 13+); TypeORM is told
  `uuidExtension: "pgcrypto"` (picks that function) and `installExtensions: false` (no `CREATE EXTENSION`).
- All timestamps are `timestamptz` (UTC instants). Emails are stored lower-case, enforced by a CHECK constraint.
- Every `@Column` states its SQL `type` explicitly. **Why:** the migration CLI runs through `tsx` (esbuild), which does
  not emit TypeScript decorator metadata, so TypeORM cannot infer types and fails to load the entities.
- Entities and migrations are registered in `src/database/data-source.ts` (explicit entity list; migrations by glob),
  used by the CLI, seed script and tests. The running app gets its connection from `AppModule`.
- Tests use a separate database via `DATABASE_URL_TEST` (name ends in `_test`).
- Env is validated at startup (`src/config/env.validation.ts`); the app refuses to start on a bad value.

### D23 — 2026-10-04 — API port 5000; clearer Postgres names
Supersedes the names in D19 and the default port 3000. API listens on **5000**.
Postgres user `car_rental_user`, password `car_rental_password`, database `car_rental_db`, test database
`car_rental_db_test` (must end in `_test`). Container and volume names are unchanged.
**Why:** user and database had the same name (`car_rental`), which made connection strings hard to read.
Changing them needs a fresh volume (`docker compose down -v`), since Postgres reads these only on first start.
